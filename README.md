# etime [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/go-eden/etime.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/go-eden/etime)

`etime` Extend golang's `time` package, to provide more and better features.

# Install

```bash
go get github.com/go-eden/etime
```

# Usage
 
This section shows all features, and their usage.
 
## Current Timestamp

This feature works like Java's `System.currentTimeMillis()`, it will return `int64` value directly:

+ `CurrentSecond`: obtain current second, use syscall for better performance
+ `CurrentMicrosecond`: obtain current microsecond, use syscall for better performance
+ `CurrentMillisecond`: obtain current millisecond, use syscall for better performance

For better performance, `Current*` didn't use `time.Now()`, because it's a bit slow. 

### Demo

```go
package main

import (
	"github.com/go-eden/etime"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	println(etime.CurrentSecond())
	println(etime.CurrentMillisecond())
	println(etime.CurrentMicrosecond())

	println(time.Now().Unix())
	println(time.Now().UnixNano() / 1e6)
	println(time.Now().UnixNano() / 1e3)
}
```

### Performance

In my benchmark, `etime.Current*`'s performance was about `40 ns/op`, and `time.Now()*`'s performance was about `68 ns/op`:

```
BenchmarkCurrentSecond-12         	30000000	        40.8 ns/op	       0 B/op	       0 allocs/op
BenchmarkCurrentMillisecond-12    	50000000	        39.7 ns/op	       0 B/op	       0 allocs/op
BenchmarkCurrentMicrosecond-12    	30000000	        39.7 ns/op	       0 B/op	       0 allocs/op
BenchmarkNowSecond-12             	20000000	        67.5 ns/op	       0 B/op	       0 allocs/op
BenchmarkNowMillisecond-12        	20000000	        68.1 ns/op	       0 B/op	       0 allocs/op
BenchmarkNowMicrosecond-12        	20000000	        67.8 ns/op	       0 B/op	       0 allocs/op
```

Under the same hardware environment, Java's `System.currentTimeMillis()` was like this:

```
Benchmark               Mode  Cnt   Score   Error  Units
TimestampBenchmark.now  avgt    9  25.697 Â± 0.139  ns/op
```

So, there should have room for improvement, and i will continue to optimize it.

Some library may be sensitive to this `28ns` optimization, like [slf4go](https://github.com/go-eden/slf4go).
